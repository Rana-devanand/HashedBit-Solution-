Notes :-
The focus of this question is on functionality, not the styling. There's no need to write any custom CSS.
You may modify the markup (e.g. adding ids, data attributes, replacing some tags, etc), but the result should remain the same visually.
You may want to think about ways to improve the user experience of the application and implement them (you get bonus credit for doing ).
